    <p>Financial illiteracy severely affects minority and lower income communities. Most of the people who inhabit these communities werenâ€™t given any proper education about saving and finances to pass down to their kids. As a result of this, the people in these communities stay stuck in the same cycle of poverty. The poor remain poor, and the rich become richer. </p>

    <p>Not only does financial illiteracy severely affect oppressed communities, but it also affects many teens and young adults who weren't taught how to save correctly upon entering adulthood. Most people don't know how to save correctly, invest, raise credit, and use the stock market. Many ADULTS in general don't even know what a Roth IRA is or what 401k actually does. It is imperative that we begin to teach mandatory finance classes to highschool students so that everyone would get a fair and proper start into adulthood.</p>

    <p> The statistics don't lie. Americans struggle with financial literacy and it's a problem thats been pushed to the side for far to long. We need to implement new ways to fix this crisis or else we'll stay stuck in the same cycle. </p>
